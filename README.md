# Energy-Monitor
A very light project that monitors the energy (CPU consumption, Memory consumption and temperature) on devices like RaspberryPi, cloud servers that have limited capability(CPU, memory) and alarm if it's dangerously high or spiking. It can also do some predictions using algorithm.


Notice this project is still in the early stage of development, with a slow pace. But I'm not giving it up.
